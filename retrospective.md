# Retrospective
* Daniel: Big thank you to the team. I could work on my old project. This gave me the chance to get a better understanding of the topic PHP PDO overall.
* Gaudenz: As one might imagine it could be bad if your team dissolves...Meh, it was not. Sure I would have liked the whole project to success but I had a big time learning experience and countless challenges every day. To me that made at least my personal take of the project a success.

## General Feelings During Project
* Daniel: Felt ok. No worries.
* Gaudenz: Felt good and had a lets go whatever it takes or whatever happens attitude. Overall pleasant and rather calm experience.

## Problems faced
* The main problem was not so much a technbical one but a general social-adminstartin-team problem. For our team shrunk every day to one person active at the end, we or better I had to make decisions in what way I would be able to at least deliver somewhat of a meaningful project.
## G: I'm looking forward to a new project, in a team that keeps members at the project until finished or in a comming solo-assignment.
Daniel: I intend to be better prepared for a next project, including the knowledge but alos the technichal tools to achieve a better result.: Better Prepattion
## Final thoughts
* with all the change of who does what and who will be working on the project until deadline, It gave me a great learning experience and a huge growth in the current topic we are working at opportunity at the moment. Im grateful for that.
